# The start of my blog
Hey, and welcome to my blog!

This article is the first of many to come, and I'm really happy that I finally finished this website and that I'm now able to share my findings and experiences with everyone who reads this.

As promised, I will post about my projects, whatever I find out about barely documented topics, or just snippets that might help you if you're looking for some quick advice.

With all of that being said:
